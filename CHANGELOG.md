All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added
- **Right Sidebar support** — Added settings configuration to align the main Sessions/Files sidebar to either the left or right side of the window. Can be toggled via Settings panel under "Window" or via "View" menu ("Move Sidebar to Right" / "Move Sidebar to Left").
- **Dynamic Icons & Insets** — Sidebar toggle button symbols and position constraints dynamically update to match the sidebar alignment (e.g. `sidebar.left`/`sidebar.right`), preventing overlap with traffic lights and other controls.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **CMUX-style split panes** — Split right with ⌘D, navigate panes with ⌥⌘←→↑↓, close pane with ⌥⇧⌘W. Split buttons (split right + close) appear at top-right corner of each pane.
- **Enhanced Git panel** — Commit ▼ dropdown menu (Commit Tracked, Amend, Signoff). Sync button with per-remote submenus (Fetch From, Pull Rebase, Push To). Auto-switches between "Fetch ▼" and "Push ▼" based on upstream status.

### Changed
- **Removed pane-local surface tabs (S1/S2/S3)** — Replaced broken drag-to-split UX with CMUX-inspired keyboard shortcuts and icon buttons. Each pane is now 1 terminal (no multi-surface per pane).

### Known Issues
- Split down (⌘⇧D) causes terminal to go black (Metal CADisplayLink not re-activated on same-window reparent).
- Split 3+ panes stack to the right (nested binary 50/50). Planned fix: N-ary PaneNode + single NSSplitView with adjustSubviews().

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Antigravity / agy and Kiro support** — Full native support for the Antigravity agent family (process-tree detection, `agy`/`antigravity` title inference, custom brand color, and the Gemini spark vector brand mark) and the Kiro agent family (process-tree detection, custom brand color, and the official Kiro brand mark in the session UI).
- **File Tree Auto-Update & Git Status** — Integrated real-time FSEvents filesystem watcher for auto-refreshing the file tree on branch switches and file changes. Added Git status color indicators directly in the file tree (yellow for modified, green for untracked, red/strikethrough for deleted).
- **Richer Sidebar UI** — Default session titles now show the active AI agent name (e.g., `Claude Code`, `Codex`, `Antigravity`, `Kiro`), while the subtitle shows the repository name, active Git branch, running command/process, and directory path.
- **Dynamic Session Group Headers** — Enlarged font size/weight of group session names (`13 semibold`) and disclosure chevrons (`15 bold`), with dynamic color highlights on hover (`textSecondary` -> `textPrimary` white).

### Fixed
- **Sidebar Reload Performance (P1)** — Cached row calculations to eliminate O(N²) calculations during table reload.
- **O(1) Surface/Tab Registry Lookup (P3)** — Added `surfaceIndex` flat map dictionary to bypass triple-nested workspace/session/tab scanning.
- **Redundant Theme Application (P4)** — Guarded `applyThemeToAllHosts()` with a theme signature key to prevent expensive restyling on simple pane switches.
- **Split Pane Layout Flicker (P5)** — Synchronously enforced `layoutSubtreeIfNeeded()` during split pane construction to eliminate double-layout layout stutter/PTY SIGWINCH.
- **Metadata Probe Deduplication (P6)** — Deduplicated CWD path checking during metadata refreshes and extended the poll interval.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Double-click window zoom & drag** — Enabled full-width window dragging and double-click maximizing/zooming across the entire top panel, including the empty space of the tab bar, the folder path/icon area in the middle of the titlebar, and the sidebar titlebar header region.
- **Grouped sessions options** — Added a context options menu (`...`) on project headers in the sidebar with options such as closing all sessions in the group, alongside disclosure chevrons to expand and collapse groups.

### Changed
- **Sidebar Tabs** — Simplified the sidebar tab navigation to show only "Sessions" and "Files" tabs, hiding the "Git" tab to keep the interface clean and focused.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Grouped sessions** — sidebar project groups now render as headers, with a `+` affordance on each header to open a new session in that project root.

### Changed
- README and changelog now describe the grouped session sidebar and the group-header add action.
- Refreshed `graphify-out` artifacts for the current codebase snapshot without committing generated HTML.

### Fixed
- Version metadata is bumped in lockstep across `HarnessVersion.swift` and `Info.plist` for release packaging.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Session row close** — session cards now show a `×` close affordance on hover and reuse the existing close-confirmation flow.
- **Run script** — `make run` / `Scripts/run.sh app` now provide one entrypoint for building, packaging, signing, and opening `Harness.app`; `make preview` remains the isolated preview path.

### Fixed
- README IDE sidebar section no longer contains stale merge-conflict markers.
- `HarnessVersion.swift` now matches the app bundle version metadata for packaging.

### Changed
- README quick install keeps developers on `make preview`, while `make run` now opens a production-style app bundle with embedded Sparkle framework.
- Refreshed `graphify-out` navigation artifacts without committed HTML output.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Files tab** — SwiftUI rewrite: click folder name to expand/collapse (DisclosureGroup)
- **Files tab** — drag file or folder from tree into terminal pastes shell-quoted path (fixed)
- **Files tab** — lazy child loading on first folder expansion
- **Drag-to-terminal** — image drag support (writes temp PNG, pastes path)
- **Drag-to-terminal** — relaxed operation mask accepts `.generic` / `.every` source masks

### Fixed
- File tree drag-drop broken: removed `registerForDraggedTypes` on NSOutlineView that conflicted with drop routing
- File tree drag-drop broken: removed empty `outlineView.action` that blocked drag initiation
- App crash on launch (macOS 26 beta): `UNUserNotificationCenter.current()` throws during `dispatch_once` init — disabled all `UNUserNotificationCenter` calls in `DesktopNotifier` and `NotificationPermission`; sound fallback preserved

### Changed
- File tree rebuilt in SwiftUI (`List` + `DisclosureGroup`) — replaced 160-line NSOutlineView+delegate implementation with 100-line SwiftUI view
- Desktop notifications disabled on macOS 26 beta (system bug — re-enable when Apple fixes `UNUserNotificationCenter` init)

### Known Issues
- Git tab checkbox stage/unstage not receiving clicks (CASE-001 — needs Xcode View Debugger)
- Desktop notifications unavailable on macOS 26 beta (workaround: sound alert still plays)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- **IDE Sidebar** — Sessions / Files / Git tabs with segmented control
- **Files tab** — project file tree (NSOutlineView) that follows active session cwd

- **Git tab** — branch switcher dropdown (click branch name)
- **Git tab** — Fetch ▾ sync dropdown (Fetch / Pull / Push / Force Push)
- **Session-as-tab** — tab bar shows sessions (1 session = 1 project), not tabs within a session
- **Tab bar +** — creates new session
- **Tab bar ✕** — always-visible close button on each tab
