Usage: Scripts/run.sh [command]

Commands:
  preview   Build and launch isolated preview app (.harness-preview) [default]
  debug     Build (debug), package, sign, and open Harness.app
  prod      Build (release), package, sign, and open Harness.app (no /Applications copy)
  run       Re-open the existing Harness.app without rebuilding
  build     Run swift build
  stop      Stop preview app
  graphify  Refresh graphify-out without committed HTML output

Examples:
  make debug              # build (debug) + open
  make prod               # build (release) + open
  make run                # just re-open the existing build
  Scripts/run.sh preview  # isolated preview
  Scripts/run.sh graphify
USAGE

# Kill any already-running instance so the new build is what actually loads —
# `open` on a running app just re-activates the old process.

# prod/run builds at the repo root are release builds, so they share the production
# HARNESS_HOME (~/Library/Application Support/Harness) with /Applications/Harness.app
# and the launchd-managed daemon (`make install`). Without stopping those too, the
# fresh repo-root app reconnects to the old launchd daemon/socket and looks unchanged.
# `debug` builds use an isolated HarnessDebug home and don't need this.
