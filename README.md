# Harness

[![CI](https://github.com/robzilla1738/harness-cli/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/robzilla1738/harness-cli/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

The native macOS terminal that keeps your sessions running and tells you the moment a coding agent needs you.

Every pane renders on Harness's own GPU engine. Your splits and sessions live in a background daemon, so they survive quitting the app and you can drive or attach to them from the command line — even over SSH. And Harness watches the agents you run inside it (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and more), so an approval prompt never sits unseen behind another tab.

One app, no external dependencies. `swift build` resolves zero packages.

## Download

**[Download Harness for macOS →](https://harnesscli.dev)**

Drag it to Applications and open it. Updates install themselves in the background, signed and verified. Requires macOS 15 or later.

Prefer to build it yourself? Jump to [Build from source](#build-from-source).

## Why Harness

- **It's a real terminal first.** GPU rendering, true 24-bit color, ligatures, inline images (Sixel / Kitty / iTerm2), and 485 built-in themes. Block and box-drawing glyphs are drawn procedurally, so borders tile without seams at any font.
- **Your work outlives the window.** Sessions, tabs, and splits are owned by a daemon. Quit and reopen and everything is exactly where you left it. Attach the same session from a second window or another machine.
- **It's scriptable.** `harness-cli` drives the whole thing — open tabs, send keys, capture a pane, resize, swap, zoom — so your tooling can build the layout it needs.
- **It watches your agents.** Harness detects Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and others by their process tree, shows which session is running what, and pings you when an agent stops or asks for approval. `Cmd+Shift+U` jumps you to the one that's waiting and skips the ones still thinking.

## How it feels

Harness ranges from a plain, get-out-of-your-way terminal to a full session manager. Pick the level in **Settings → Terminal → Experience**:

- **Plain Terminal** — fast and quiet. No command prefix, no status bar. Sessions close when you quit, like any terminal.
- **Persistent Terminal** — the same clean look, but sessions survive quitting and you can attach to them from the CLI.
- **Full Terminal** — everything: command prefix, status line, copy mode, paste buffers, panes, and the full `harness-cli` command set.
- **Agent Workspace** — persistent project workspaces with agent detection and notifications turned up front.

New installs start in Plain. Moving over from another setup? See [docs/MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md) — Harness can import an existing terminal config (colors, font, padding) on first run.

## Features

- GPU-accelerated rendering by Harness's own terminal engine — Display-P3 / sRGB color, a themed translucent canvas, and program output left untouched unless you opt into theme recoloring
- Sidebar sessions, per-session tabs, and horizontal / vertical splits
- Session layout persists across quits (daemon-owned, attach from the CLI or over SSH)
- `harness-cli` for automation and agent hooks
- Command set: `send-keys`, `capture-pane`, `kill-pane`, `resize-pane`, `zoom-pane`, `swap-pane`, `rename-tab`, `attach`, and more
- Command prefix keymap (default `Ctrl-A`) with a live cheatsheet (prefix `?`)
- Agent detection for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Pi, Hermes, OpenClaw, OpenCode, Aider, Gemini, and Goose — each with a brand color and a sidebar chip
- Agent alerts as desktop banners, a sidebar bell, and pane rings; `Cmd+Shift+U` jumps to whoever is waiting
- One-line hook install: `harness-cli install-hooks <agent>`
- Command palette (`Cmd+K`) and a fully themed Settings window (`Cmd+,`)
- 485 built-in color themes, plus `.harnesstheme` export / import for sharing
- Shell integration (OSC 133): prompt marks for jump-to-prompt and a command success / failure gutter — bash / zsh / fish snippets in [docs/shell-integration/](docs/shell-integration/README.md)
- Inline images that stay put across reflow and scroll into history
- Automatic, signed background updates (Sparkle + EdDSA)

## harness-cli

Harness launches its daemon automatically; the CLI talks to it.

```bash
harness-cli list-surfaces
harness-cli new-session --workspace Default --cwd ~/Code/myproject
harness-cli new-tab --workspace Default --cwd ~/Code/myproject
harness-cli send-keys --surface "$HARNESS_SURFACE" --keys "ls -la Enter"
harness-cli notify --surface "$HARNESS_SURFACE" --title Agent --body "Needs approval"
```

Install it onto your `PATH`:

```bash
# From the app bundle:
/Applications/Harness.app/Contents/MacOS/harness-cli install

# Or from a source build:
.build/release/harness-cli install

# Then add the printed path to your shell profile:
export PATH="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Harness/bin:$PATH"
```

## Agent hooks

`HARNESS_SURFACE` is set in every Harness pane, so an agent can ping the exact tab it's running in:

```bash
harness-cli install-hooks claude-code
harness-cli notify --surface "$HARNESS_SURFACE" --body "Approval required"
```

Per-agent setup lives in [docs/agent-hooks/README.md](docs/agent-hooks/README.md). Agents without a hook mechanism still notify you through Harness's built-in activity detection once they're running.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| New tab | `Cmd+T` |
| New workspace | `Cmd+Shift+N` |
| Close tab | `Cmd+W` |
| Split horizontal / vertical | `Cmd+D` / `Cmd+Shift+D` |
| Switch to tab 1–9 | `Cmd+1` … `Cmd+9` |
| Previous / next tab | `Cmd+Shift+[` / `Cmd+Shift+]` |
| Jump to waiting agent | `Cmd+Shift+U` |
| Command palette | `Cmd+K` |
| Settings | `Cmd+,` |
| Toggle sidebar | `Cmd+\` |

The command prefix (default `Ctrl-A`) adds the full pane / session keymap on top — press prefix then `?` for the cheatsheet.

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robzilla1738/harness-cli.git harness
cd harness
make release
open Harness.app
```

### Develop in Xcode

`Harness.xcodeproj` is generated from `project.yml` with XcodeGen. The app target builds and bundles `HarnessDaemon` and `harness-cli` into `Harness.app/Contents/MacOS/`, so an Xcode run uses the same helper layout as the release app.

```bash
xcodegen generate
open Harness.xcodeproj
xcodebuild -project Harness.xcodeproj -scheme Harness -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' build test
```

### Sign and notarize a release

```bash
export SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
export APPLE_ID="you@example.com"
export APPLE_TEAM_ID="TEAMID"
export APPLE_APP_PASSWORD="app-specific-password"

make release                  # Harness.app with embedded harness-cli + HarnessDaemon
./Scripts/sign-and-notarize.sh
make dmg                       # Harness.dmg, drag-to-Applications install
```
