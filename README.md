# Harness

> Forked from [robzilla1738/harness-terminal](https://github.com/robzilla1738/harness-terminal)

The native macOS terminal that keeps your sessions running and tells you the moment a coding agent needs you.

Every pane renders on Harness's own GPU engine. Your splits and sessions live in a background daemon, so they survive quitting the app — and their scrollback survives a daemon restart. You can drive or attach to them from the command line, including a headless or remote daemon over SSH. And Harness watches the agents you run inside it (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and more), so an approval prompt never sits unseen behind another tab.

One self-contained app. The terminal engine, daemon, and CLI are all first-party Swift; the only external dependency is Sparkle (the macOS auto-update framework, GUI-only).

## Install

Build from source (see [Build from source](#build-from-source) below) — this fork does not publish prebuilt DMGs.

## Why Harness

- **It's a real terminal first.** GPU rendering, accurate sRGB color by default, opt-in converted Display-P3 vivid color, ligatures, inline images (Sixel / Kitty / iTerm2), and 490 built-in themes with a muted Harness default. Block and box-drawing glyphs are drawn procedurally, so borders tile without seams at any font.
- **Your work outlives the window.** Sessions, tabs, and splits are owned by a daemon. Quit and reopen and everything is exactly where you left it, scrollback included — history is persisted to disk and restored even if the daemon restarts. Attach the same session from a second window or another machine.
- **It's scriptable, locally or remotely.** `harness-cli` drives the whole thing — open tabs, send keys, capture a pane, resize, swap, zoom — so your tooling can build the layout it needs. Point any command at a headless or remote daemon with `--host <name>`; the daemon and CLI run on Linux too, so a remote box can host your sessions.
- **It watches your agents.** Harness detects Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and others by their process tree, shows which session is running what, and pings you when an agent stops or asks for approval. `Cmd+Shift+U` jumps you to the one that's waiting and skips the ones still thinking.

## How it feels

Harness ranges from a plain, get-out-of-your-way terminal to a full session manager. Pick the level in **Settings → Terminal → Experience**:

- **Plain Terminal** — fast and quiet. No command prefix, no status bar. Sessions close when you quit, like any terminal.
- **Persistent Terminal** — the same clean look, but sessions survive quitting and you can attach to them from the CLI.
- **Full Terminal** — everything: command prefix, status line, copy mode, paste buffers, panes, and the full `harness-cli` command set.
- **Agent Workspace** — persistent project workspaces with agent detection and notifications turned up front.

New installs start in Plain. Moving over from another setup? See [docs/MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md) — Harness can import an existing terminal config (colors, font, padding) on first run.

## Features

- GPU-accelerated rendering by Harness's own terminal engine — accurate sRGB output by default, opt-in converted Display-P3 vivid color, a themed translucent canvas, and program output left untouched unless you opt into theme recoloring
- Mainstream-GPU-terminal polish: live re-wrap while resizing (with a grid-size overlay), word / line / block selection, middle-click paste, alternate-screen wheel scrolling, focus reporting, hollow unfocused cursor, minimum contrast, auto light/dark themes, bold-is-bright control, and paste protection
- Sidebar sessions, per-session tabs, and horizontal splits
- Session layout persists across quits (daemon-owned, attach from the CLI or over SSH)
- Persistent scrollback: a pane's history is written to disk per surface and restored when the daemon restarts
- Remote & headless daemon: run `HarnessDaemon` on a headless or remote box (Linux included) and drive it with `harness-cli --host <name>` over an SSH tunnel — register hosts with `harness-cli remote add`
- `harness-cli` for automation and agent hooks
- Color/theme diagnostics from the CLI: `harness-cli color-check` and `harness-cli theme-preview --theme <name>` print deterministic SGR pages for eyeballing fidelity in Harness itself
- Command set: `send-keys`, `capture-pane`, `kill-pane`, `resize-pane`, `zoom-pane`, `swap-pane`, `rename-tab`, `attach`, and more
- Command prefix keymap (default `Ctrl-A`) with a live cheatsheet (prefix `?`)
- Agent detection for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Grok, Pi, Hermes, OpenClaw, OpenCode, Aider, Gemini, Goose, Antigravity, and Kiro — each with a brand color and a sidebar chip
- Agent alerts as desktop banners and a sidebar bell; `Cmd+Shift+U` jumps to whoever is waiting
- One-line hook install: `harness-cli install-hooks <agent>`
- Command palette (`Cmd+K`) and a native macOS Settings window (`Cmd+,`)
- 490 built-in color themes with a muted Harness default, plus `.harnesstheme` export / import for sharing
- Shell integration (OSC 133): prompt marks for jump-to-prompt and a command success / failure gutter — bash / zsh / fish snippets in [docs/shell-integration/](docs/shell-integration/README.md)
- Inline images that stay put across reflow and scroll into history
- Drag files, folders, or images into a pane to insert shell-quoted paths
- Set Harness as the default terminal for SSH/Telnet/man-page links and `.command` / `.tool` files from Settings > Terminal
- **IDE sidebar** — Sessions, Files, and Git panels toggled with `Cmd+\`
- **Project-aware file tree** — SwiftUI tree with folder expand/collapse, right-click context menu (New File, Rename, Duplicate, Move to Trash, Reveal in Finder)
- **File editor panel** — click a file to preview in a split panel (30% editor, 70% terminal). Vi-like mode: read-only by default, press `i` to edit, `Esc` to return. `⌘S` saves, `⌘F` finds, `⌘⇧F` replaces.
- **Syntax highlighting** — Swift, TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, JSON, YAML with colored keywords, strings, comments, and numbers
- **Git diff gutter** — green/yellow/red bars next to line numbers showing added/modified/deleted lines
- **Git workflow** — stage/unstage files, commit (with amend & signoff), fetch/pull/push (with per-remote and rebase options), branch switcher, and worktree controls from the sidebar
- **CMUX pane splitting** — drag surface tabs to split left/right with live drop overlays and ratio auto-restoration
- **Sidebar position** — move sidebar to left or right via View menu or right-click (real-time toggle, persists across restarts)
- **Session-as-tab** — each top tab is a project session; sidebar group headers can create a new session in that group with `+`, and the session card `×` appears on hover to close it
- **Recent projects** — clock button in the sidebar footer shows the last 10 project roots and switches to an existing session on duplicate

## Philosophy — Terminal First, IDE Convenience

Harness is a **terminal** — not an editor that happens to have a terminal panel. Every feature (file tree, git panel, file viewer) is a shortcut that saves you from typing `cat`, `git status`, or `vim`. Nothing *requires* the GUI; it just makes common workflows faster.

Think: **tmux + lazygit + bat + fzf** — built-in, zero config, native macOS.

## IDE Sidebar

Toggle the sidebar with `Cmd+\`. It has three panels:

### Session Panel

Each project session appears as a tab in the sidebar tab bar. The session panel gives you:

- **+ button** — opens a new session in the current working directory
- **Group header `+`** — adds a new session inside that project group, using the group root as the working directory
- **× button** — appears on session card hover and closes the session after confirmation
- **Recent projects** — clock button in the sidebar footer lists the last 10 visited project roots; clicking one switches to an existing session or opens a new one
- Sessions are daemon-owned, so they survive quitting and relaunching the app

### Files

A project-aware file tree that stays in sync with your active terminal session:

- Automatically roots to the current working directory of the active pane
- Single-click to open a file; right-click to copy the full path
- Drag a file or folder into a terminal pane to insert its shell-quoted path
- Tree updates when you `cd` in the terminal
- **Git status colors** in the file tree (yellow for modified, green for untracked, red/strikethrough for deleted)
- **FSEvents watcher** for real-time auto-refresh on Git branch switches and filesystem updates

### Git

A three-tab Git panel covering the full day-to-day workflow without leaving the app:

**Changes tab**
- Lists every modified, staged, added, and deleted file with colour-coded status (orange = modified, green = added/untracked, red = deleted)
- Checkbox per file to stage or unstage individually; **Stage All** button to stage everything at once
- Commit message field + **Commit ▼** menu — Commit Tracked, Amend, Signoff
- Branch name at the bottom — click it to switch branches from a menu
- **Sync button** (Fetch ▼ / Push ▼) — contextual menu: Fetch, Fetch From (per-remote), Pull, Pull (Rebase), Push, Push To (per-remote), Force Push; auto-switches to "Push" when ahead of upstream

**History tab**
- Shows the last 25 commits: subject line, author, relative time, and short hash
- Scrollable card list, same visual style as the Changes tab

**Worktrees tab**
- Lists all `git worktree` entries for the current repo: folder name (bold), branch, and short HEAD hash
- **✕** button on each row to run `git worktree remove` (hidden for the main worktree)
- **+** button at the top right — prompts for a path and branch name, then runs `git worktree add`

## harness-cli

Harness launches its daemon automatically; the CLI talks to it.

```bash
harness-cli list-surfaces
harness-cli new-session --workspace Default --cwd ~/Code/myproject
harness-cli new-tab --workspace Default --cwd ~/Code/myproject
harness-cli send-keys --surface "$HARNESS_SURFACE" --keys "ls -la Enter"
harness-cli notify --surface "$HARNESS_SURFACE" --title Agent --body "Needs approval"
harness-cli color-check
harness-cli theme-preview --theme "Harness Default"
```

Install it onto your `PATH`:

```bash
# From the built app:
./Harness.app/Contents/MacOS/harness-cli install

# Then add the printed path to your shell profile:
export PATH="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Harness/bin:$PATH"
```

The first-run setup in `Harness.app` performs the same local installation for new
users: it copies `harness-cli` and `HarnessDaemon`, registers the LaunchAgent,
adds PATH blocks for zsh/bash/fish with backups, installs fish completions, asks
for notification permission, and offers detected agent hooks.

## Remote & headless daemons

`HarnessDaemon` can run on a headless box (no GUI) or a remote machine — including
Linux — and you can drive it from any `harness-cli` command with a global
`--host <name>` flag. The transport is an SSH tunnel that forwards the remote
daemon's control socket, so it reuses your existing SSH trust with no new
credentials.

```bash
# On the remote box: run the daemon and note its socket path (harness-cli doctor prints it).
# On your machine: register the remote, then target it with --host on any command.
harness-cli remote add --name devbox --ssh me@devbox --socket "/home/me/.config/harness/harness.sock"
harness-cli remote list
harness-cli ping --host devbox
harness-cli new-session --host devbox --cwd ~/Code
harness-cli send-keys --host devbox --surface <id> --keys "ls -la Enter"
harness-cli capture-pane --host devbox --surface <id>
harness-cli remote remove --name devbox
```

Pass extra SSH options (port, identity file, jump host) with `--ssh-arg`, e.g.
`--ssh-arg -p --ssh-arg 2222 --ssh-arg -i --ssh-arg ~/.ssh/devbox`.

## Agent hooks

`HARNESS_SURFACE` is set in every Harness pane, so an agent can ping the exact tab it's running in:

```bash
harness-cli install-hooks claude-code
harness-cli notify --surface "$HARNESS_SURFACE" --body "Approval required"
```

Per-agent setup lives in [docs/agent-hooks/README.md](docs/agent-hooks/README.md). Agents without a hook mechanism still notify you through Harness's built-in activity detection once they're running.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| New tab | `Cmd+T` |
| New session | `Cmd+Shift+N` |
| Close tab | `Cmd+W` |
| Split horizontal / vertical | `Cmd+D` / `Cmd+Shift+D` |
| Switch to tab 1–9 | `Cmd+1` … `Cmd+9` |
| Previous / next tab | `Cmd+Shift+[` / `Cmd+Shift+]` |
| Jump to waiting agent | `Cmd+Shift+U` |
| Command palette | `Cmd+K` |
| Settings | `Cmd+,` |
| Toggle sidebar | `Cmd+\` |

The command prefix (default `Ctrl-A`) adds the full pane / session keymap on top — press prefix then `?` for the cheatsheet.

## Build from source

### Prerequisites

- Apple silicon Mac running **macOS 15.0+**
- **Xcode 16+** / Swift 6.0
- (Optional) [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) for Xcode project regeneration

### Quick install

```bash
make preview
```

`make preview` builds and launches an isolated preview app under `.harness-preview/`.
For a production-style app bundle, run `make run` or `Scripts/run.sh app`; it
builds, packages, signs, and opens `Harness.app`.

### Install CLI + Daemon

```bash
# From the built app:
./Harness.app/Contents/MacOS/harness-cli install

# Add to your shell profile:
export PATH="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Harness/bin:$PATH"
```

Or install from source directly:

```bash
swift build -c release
cp .build/release/harness-cli /usr/local/bin/
cp .build/release/HarnessDaemon /usr/local/bin/
```

### Development preview

```bash
make preview            # build + launch preview app (isolated from production)
make run                # build + package + sign + open Harness.app
Scripts/run.sh graphify # refresh graphify-out and delete generated HTML
make preview-stop       # stop preview
```

Validate a source checkout before shipping changes:

```bash
swift build
swift test                              # fast, deterministic suite
HARNESS_LIVE_DAEMON_TESTS=1 swift test  # adds the real socket / PTY / security tests
make bench
```

CI runs all three on every push: the deterministic suite, the live daemon tests, and a release build. The live tests spin up a real daemon over a Unix socket and a real PTY, so run them locally before changing the daemon, IPC, or PTY code.

`make bench` runs opt-in release benchmarks and prints machine-readable JSON timing lines. Treat those as a structural baseline, not a pass/fail gate — GPU and timing numbers vary by machine.

Renderer tests use structural offscreen readbacks by default. Set `HARNESS_WRITE_RENDER_SNAPSHOTS=1` when running `swift test --filter MetalRendererTests` to write PNGs under `/tmp/HarnessRenderSnapshots` for human debugging only.

### Develop in Xcode

`Harness.xcodeproj` is generated from `project.yml` with XcodeGen. The app target builds and bundles `HarnessDaemon` and `harness-cli` into `Harness.app/Contents/MacOS/`, so an Xcode run uses the same helper layout as the release app.

```bash
xcodegen generate
open Harness.xcodeproj
xcodebuild -project Harness.xcodeproj -scheme Harness -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' build test
```

## Requirements

- Apple silicon Mac running macOS 15.0 or later for the GUI app
- Xcode 16+ / Swift 6.0 (to build from source)
- For a headless/remote daemon: any machine with Swift 6.0 (macOS or Linux) — build the daemon + CLI with `swift build -c release` (the GUI app, renderer, and Sparkle are macOS-only and are dropped from the Linux build)
