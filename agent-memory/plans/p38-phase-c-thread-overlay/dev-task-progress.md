# P38 Phase C — Agent Thread UX on Existing Block Capture — Dev Task Progress

Design: `design.md` (same folder) — see "Pivot" section at the top; the original overlay-based
plan (tasks below marked "original, superseded") was built, gated green, then deleted mid live-test
and replaced by a merge into the existing Recipes picker. Current architecture:
`Apps/Kouen/Sources/KouenApp/UI/Shared/RecipePickerController.swift`.

## Stage 1-2 — Engine/surface plumbing (built 2026-07-14, unchanged by the pivot, still in use)

- [x] 1. `TerminalEmulator.swift`: `public var blocks: [TerminalBlock] { blockStore.blocks }`.
- [x] 2. Test: `Tests/KouenTerminalEngineTests/TerminalBlockStoreTests.swift` — accessor returns order + running/finished mix.
- [x] 3. `KouenTerminalSurfaceView`: `public var blocks: [TerminalBlock]` (via `emulatorSync`), `public func jumpToBlock(promptLine:)` in `+Scrollback.swift`, delegates to `scrollToBufferLine` (already clamps).

## Original overlay build (built 2026-07-14, gated green, then deleted 2026-07-15 mid live-test)

- [x] 4. ~~`TerminalThreadOverlay.swift` (NSTableView-based full-pane overlay)~~ — **deleted**. Close button collided with `PaneSplitButtonsView` (fixed once, top-anchor offset 44pt matching `TerminalFindBar`), but double-click and the filter affordance never worked and root cause was never found before the pivot below made the whole class moot.
- [x] 5. ~~`TerminalHostView.toggleThreadView()`/`showThreadView()`/`hideThreadView()`~~ — **reverted**, removed entirely.
- [x] 6. ~~`SessionCoordinator.toggleThreadView()` + `BannerShortcutRegistry.threadView` (⇧⌘L) + "Thread View" menu item~~ — **reverted**, removed entirely. `toggleFindBar()` back to its original simple form.
- [x] 7. ~~Contextual ⌘F routing to the overlay's filter field~~ — **reverted** along with the overlay.
- [x] 8. ~~`Tests/KouenTerminalKitTests/ThreadOverlayTests.swift` (5 tests)~~ — **deleted** along with the overlay it tested.
- [x] 9. Gate at the time (build/test/robot green, 26/26) — moot now; superseded by the gate under "Pivot" below.

## Pivot — merge into the Recipes picker (2026-07-15)

- [x] 10. `RecipePickerController.swift`: added `PickerItem` enum (`.recipe`/`.historyBlock`), rewrote `RecipePickerModel` to hold both, most-recent-history-first ordering, `activateSelected()` branches per case (recipe → send/composer as before; history block → `host.jumpToBlock(promptLine:)`, new).
- [x] 11. `RecipePickerView`/`PickerItemRow` (renamed from `RecipeItemRow`): renders both item kinds — history rows get a clock icon, red-tinted "exit N" subtitle on failure, "Jump" badge; recipe rows unchanged. Search placeholder updated to "Search recipes & history...".
- [x] 12. Single shortcut: removed the duplicate `BannerShortcutRegistry.threadView` (⇧⌘L) and its "Recent Commands" menu item alias — ⌘⇧R is the only entry point, per explicit user request after confirming the merged picker worked. Menu item renamed "Recipes…" → "Recipes & History…".
- [x] 13. Gate: `swift build --product Kouen` green, `Tests/robot/run.sh` green (26/26).
- [x] 14. `Tests/KouenAppTests/RecipePickerModelMergeTests.swift` (11 tests) — `PickerItem` id/searchableText per kind, merge ordering (history before recipes, caller order preserved), query filtering across both kinds (case-insensitive, empty-query restore, no-match clears), `selectedIndex` clamp-on-shrink, `moveSelection` wrap-around both directions and no-op on empty. `TerminalBlock` fixtures built via real OSC 133 feed through `TerminalEmulator` (same pattern as `TerminalBlockStoreTests` — the struct's memberwise init is internal to `KouenTerminalEngine`, can't construct directly cross-module). Does not cover `activateSelected()`'s dispatch to `jumpToBlock`/send/composer — that needs a live `SessionCoordinator`/`TerminalHostView`, no meaningful way to assert it without one; left for the live check below.
- [ ] 15. **Live check (required, not done)**: open ⌘⇧R, confirm the list shows both saved recipes and recent history in one flat list, search filters both, and selecting a history item (click / double-click / Enter) jumps the terminal viewport to that command's output correctly — this exact interaction was the one that never worked in the deleted overlay and has not been re-verified since the rewrite.

## Thread grouping — Zed framing folded into the same picker (2026-07-15)

User asked whether Zed's turn-by-turn "thread" framing (missing from the flat-list pivot above)
could be added without a second shortcut. Clarified via `AskUserQuestion`: group by originating
pane, rendered as inline headers in the existing list — not a separate UI or filter chip.

- [x] 16. `PickerItem.historyBlock` now carries `surfaceID` and `paneLabel`, not just the bare
  `TerminalBlock` — needed so `activateSelected()` can jump the pane a block actually came from
  (`coord.setActiveSurface(surfaceID)` + `host.jumpToBlock`) instead of always assuming the
  currently-active pane, now that history spans every pane in the tab.
- [x] 17. `RecipePickerController.present`: gathers history from every leaf in the active tab's
  `rootPane` (was: only `coordinator.activeSurfaceID`), tagging each block with its pane's
  `PaneSurface.label` (falls back to `"Pane N"` by position if unset).
- [x] 18. `PickerItem.groupLabel` (nil for recipes) + `GroupHeaderRow` — `RecipePickerView`'s
  `ForEach` inserts a header whenever consecutive items' `groupLabel` differs, via a local
  `Array.subscript(safe:)` helper (no cross-package dependency pulled in for one one-liner).
- [x] 19. Tests: 3 new cases in `RecipePickerModelMergeTests.swift` — group label per kind,
  multi-pane history stays grouped (not interleaved by time) when the caller concatenates panes
  in order. 14/14 pass.
- [x] 20. Gate: `swift build`/`Tests/robot/run.sh` green (27/27).

## Summary

Completed: 19 (3 still-valid plumbing tasks + 6 overlay tasks now moot/reverted + 5 pivot tasks +
5 grouping tasks). Remaining: 1 — live check (15), now also covering thread-header rendering and
cross-pane jump-to-block, neither of which has been seen live yet.

## Status: Implementation pivoted mid-phase from a standalone overlay to a merge into the existing
Recipes picker, per explicit user direction during live testing, then extended with per-pane
"thread" grouping folded into the same single-shortcut picker. Build/test/robot green throughout.
Still missing the live check — now the largest remaining risk, since cross-pane jump-to-block
(`activateSelected()` targeting a non-active pane's surface) is new, untested-live behavior on top
of the original double-click bug that motivated the whole pivot.
