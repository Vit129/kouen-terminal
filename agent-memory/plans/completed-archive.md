# Completed Plans Archive

All plans below are **done** and merged into main.

---

## P1 — Sidebar Performance (v1.3.0)
- Cached `sidebarRows` (O(1) per NSTableView delegate call)
- `surfaceIndex` dict for O(1) surface lookup
- Theme guard (skip `applyThemeToAllHosts` when unchanged)
- Metadata probe dedup (one git probe per directory per cycle)
- Sync divider positioning (layoutSubtreeIfNeeded before setPosition)

## P3 — N-ary Split Panes (v1.5.0)
- Same-direction flatten into single NSSplitView + N subviews
- Equal distribution in `layout()` at `totalSize/N` intervals
- `isApplyingPositions` recursion guard
- Host reuse (detach before rebuild, re-insert without losing Metal)
- `viewDidMoveToSuperview()` fix for CADisplayLink restart
- Split down removed entirely

## P6 — UI Polish (v1.5.0)
- SF Symbols everywhere (disclosure chevrons, group buttons, worktree remove)
- `HarnessDesign.configurePillButton()` shared helper
- `FontSize`, `IconSize`, `symbolConfig()` design tokens
- Animated disclosure chevron rotation
- Git stage checkbox pulse animation
- Sidebar vibrancy `.sidebar` material

## Sidebar & Split Issues (v1.6.0)
- Sidebar left/right toggle — real-time (no restart)
- NSSplitView reorder via remove+reinsert (CASE-007)
- Right-click context menu for position toggle
- Traffic light inset handled for both positions

## Session Grouping (v1.3.0)
- `SidebarSessionRow` enum (groupHeader + session)
- Project group by git root
- Collapse/expand with animated chevron
- Drag/drop with session ID (not row index)
- Group header `+` and `...` buttons (SF Symbols)

## Panel Session Performance (v1.3.0)
- All P1–P6 perf fixes merged
- F1: File tree auto-update per session (git status dots, FSEvents watcher)

## P6 — File Editor Opacity Parity (v2.2.3 / Unreleased, 2026-06-09)
- `refreshEditorPanelFill()` in `ContentAreaViewController` — applies `terminalBackground × opacity` to the `fileEditorPanel` CALayer
- Wired into `applyChrome()` (responds to theme/opacity changes) and `showFileEditorSplit()` (panel creation)
- Subviews (FileEditorView, FileEditorTabBarView, SyntaxTextView, gutter) required no changes — all already transparent
- Key insight: Metal renderer handles terminal alpha itself; AppKit-only panels must apply it explicitly to their layer
- `HarnessSettings.clampedOpacity` returns `Float` — must cast to `CGFloat` for `withAlphaComponent`

## P2 — Async IPC Refactor
- IPC and metadata refresh moved off the main actor via `DaemonClientActor` and async background task contexts
- `SessionCoordinator` snapshot sync no longer blocks UI interactions on daemon round-trips

## P9 — Complexity Reduction
- Extracted `LiveResizeGeometry`, `PasteController`, and `SelectionResolver` from terminal surface code
- Split CLI handlers into `HarnessCLI+*.swift` extension files while preserving command dispatch behavior
- Extracted `WindowInputRouter` with focused CLI tests
- Extracted daemon `HookExecutor` and `FormatContextBuilder`
- Documented intentional `GridCompositor` duplication between app and onboarding packages

## P10 — Terminal Performance and Convenience
- Lazy scrollback reflow shipped for live resize performance
- Local workspace symbol completion and completion popup shipped
- IDE mode, focus mode, session state dots, diff highlighting, git preview/history improvements, and task board sidebar shipped
- ACP sidebar work remains intentionally shelved; implementation is preserved but not exposed

## P5 — ACP Client
- ACP core implementation exists in `HarnessCore/ACP`: `ACPClient`, `ACPSession`, `ACPProcess`, `ACPTransport`, `ACPMessage`, and `AgentConfig`
- `AgentChatPanelView` and settings-side ACP agent configuration remain in the app code
- Runtime entry point is intentionally disabled in the sidebar (`[ACP SHELVED] connectAgentIfNeeded()`)
- Shelved rationale is tracked in `agent-memory/knowledge/acp-client.md`

## P7 — Sidebar UI Polish
- Large-screen sidebar group header button visibility/alignment completed
- Session card spacing and file editor tab bar overlap polish completed

## P4 — Terminal-First Code Viewing + LSP
- Track 1 (Syntax Highlighting): `SyntaxTextView` regex-based, 30+ languages, wired into `FileViewerViewController`
- Track 2 (Vi Navigation): `gf` path-under-cursor, `gd`/`K`/`]d`/`[d` LSP-backed, `:view`/`:edit`/`:split`/`:vsplit`/`:find`, `harness view` CLI
- Track 3 (LSP Command API): `harness lsp start/status/hover/definition/diagnostics`
- Follow-ups (`:recent`, `:grep`, `:make`) moved to P24

## P21 — Hermes-Inspired Agent Platform (Shelved → P24 partial)
- Status: Shelved — ACP adapters not publicly available
- Actionable UX layer (agent auto-start, status badges, selection via config) absorbed into P24
- Remaining layers (ACP sideband, multi-provider, brain, orchestration, execution backends) stay shelved for future re-enable
- AgentCatalog + `:agent` ex command + AgentBridge partially implemented and preserved

## P22 — Long-Session Responsiveness Hardening
- Adaptive polling (skip-on-idle when no PTY output for 10s)
- Off-main output processing for metadata refresh
- Scrollback compaction (trim to N lines when idle)
- Renderer micro-batch (coalesce rapid redraws)
- `salvageRowKeys` optimization for grid diff
- Snapshot fanout: `metadataOnly` flag prevents unnecessary UI rebuilds

## P11 — Scripting & Config API (WezTerm parity)
- `harness.config.get/set` (11 allowlisted keys)
- `harness.keys.bind/unbind/reload`
- `harness.commands.run` (Promise-based)
- Pane mutators: `sendText/split/close`, session `spawn`
- `harness.events.on/off` bridge (snapshotChanged/configReloaded)
- All in `ScriptAPI.swift`

## P12 — Agent Orchestration via MCP
- PBI-ORCH-001–005 complete
- `harness-mcp` server exposes session/pane/surface tools
- MCP badge on tab bar via `lastMCPControlAt`
- Tool policy gating for agent actions

## P13 — Split Pane Parity
- PBI-SPLIT-001–005 implemented
- Same-direction flatten, equal distribution, resize handles
- Pane zoom/unzoom, rotate, swap
- tmux-compatible split commands (`:sp`, `:vsp`)
- Merged via PR #10

## P15 — Integration Roadmap
- Sequencing plan for P4+P11+P12+P13+P14+P16
- All steps complete — coordination artifact, not a feature itself

## P16 — Agent/Session Board
- PBI-BOARD-001–005 complete (006 closed — auto-clear sufficient)
- Sidebar board tab: session cards with agent status, timing, output summary
- CLI: `harness-cli board`
- MCP read-only exposure

## P17 — Structural Refactor
- PBI-001/002/003/005 complete
- SessionCoordinator decomposed into services
- UI/ subfolder reorganization
- PBI-004 deferred (build time 9s, not worth risk)

## P18 — UI Automation (Robot Framework)
- 25 automated tests via Robot Framework + osascript (System Events)
- CLI verification paths
- No Appium/XCUITest dependency
- Accessibility identifiers added to key UI elements

## P19 — Terminal Workbench Migration Layer
- PBI-WB-001–007 fully implemented
- `:find`, `:grep`, `:make`, `:errors`, `:recent` workbench commands
- IDE migrant bridge (VS Code-like workflows in terminal)

## P20 — Harness-Term Agent (Shelved)
- Shelved — terminal-first flow sufficient (kiro-cli/claude/codex typed directly)
- Revisit when pain point emerges
- Design docs preserved for future re-enable

## P14 — Embedded Browser Pane
- PBI-BROWSER-001–005 implemented
- WKWebView pane for localhost preview
- harness-mcp browser tools (navigate, screenshot, evaluate)
- Post-release fixes in v2.7.1

## P24 — Supacode-Inspired Competitive Features (Consolidated)
- Status: Complete (archived from active plan list on 2026-06-20)
- Competitive analysis consolidated Supacode, P21 actionable agent layer, and P4 follow-ups into Harness-specific parity work.
- Key completed scope: project config/lifecycle scripts direction, agent status/auto-start UX, worktree-per-session model, GitHub PR/CI integration plan, sidebar density, and CLI scripting model.
- P21 ACP sideband/provider/brain/execution layers remain shelved separately; P4 follow-ups were absorbed into P24.
