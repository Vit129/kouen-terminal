| 44 | CASE-028: ⌘1-9 verified/kept as Switch to Session N (selectWorkspaceNumber→selectSession); added ⌘[/⌘] = Previous/Next Session (selectAdjacentSession); removed dead selectTabNumber/selectTab(atIndex:)/selectAdjacentTab; menu cleanup (removed New Tab, Layout presets, native fullscreen; Toggle Focus Mode → Show Git Panel ⌘G); fixed make preview socket path | ✅ Done |
| 45 | Notification dropdown keyboard nav (arrow/Enter/Escape + first-responder restore); tab bar close-button vs ⌘N badge overlap at rest fix | ✅ Done |
| 46 | CASE-029: terminal text selection survives scroll — selectionAnchor/Head now virtual-line coords (matches CopyModeGridSource convention); removed clearSelection() on scroll; copy reads via TerminalEmulator.line(_:) | ✅ Done |
| 47 | Rework file-tree sidebar search with Spotlight-style relevance ranking, fuzzy fallback, suffix matching, robust path value checking, search safety checks, and fix git status update/blinking issues | ✅ Done |
| 48 | AI-Agent Notification Rings (TerminalHostView.isWaiting + syncWaitingRings) and ⌘⇧U notifications dropdown wiring | ✅ Done |
| 49 | Quick Select Mode (⌘⇧Y) removed at user's request — didn't work, all related code deleted (HarnessTerminalSurfaceView+QuickSelect.swift, +Input.swift hook, TerminalHostView.enterQuickSelectMode, MainMenuBuilder menu item) | ✅ Done |
| 50 | Fix git history card click not opening file preview (GitPanelView: replaced dead NSClickGestureRecognizer with HistoryCardView.onTap closure) | ✅ Done |
| 51 | Investigate terminal panel black-flash when opening file preview from Git Changes/History/file-tree (even fresh tabs); not last-line scroll after preview open | 🔍 In progress |
| 52 | P13 Split Pane Parity (PBI-SPLIT-001..005): removed SessionCoordinator vertical-split gate, added "Split Down" UI affordances (hover, tab/sidebar menus, main menu, command palette), wired ratio/firstPaneID/secondPaneID for stacked NSSplitView, axis-aware adjustRatio fix in SessionEditor, docs updated for split-window/join-pane/move-pane -v. Build + 560/560 HarnessCoreTests + 63/63 HarnessAppTests pass. Merged via PR #10 | ✅ Done |
| 53 | P12 PBI-ORCH-001: harness-mcp `harnessList` + `readPaneOutput` read-only tools (HarnessDaemonTools.swift) | ✅ Done |
| 54 | P12 PBI-ORCH-002/003: harness-mcp env-gated pane/session control tools plus waitForPaneOutput | ✅ Done |
| 55 | P12 PBI-ORCH-004/005: persisted MCP tool policy for mutating tools; scoped UI visibility design note only | ✅ Done |
| 56 | P4 Track 1 Syntax Highlighting: verified and structured. Integrated SyntaxTextView highlighting (regex-based heuristics supporting 30+ languages) in FileViewerViewController; preserved size guards, binary/non-UTF8 placeholders, copy/select and scroll behaviors; added SyntaxHighlighterTests.swift verifying correctness; noted CLI cat/view commands absence. | ✅ Done |
| 57 | P15 plan: integration roadmap for P4+P10+P11+P12+P13/P14 — maps shared primitives (pane/session command facade, PaneNode split tree, harness.events bridge), flags divergent P4 docs, recommends merge/sequencing order. P16 plan: Kanban-style Agent/Session Board (Jira/Trello/Devin-Windsurf parity) for GUI sidebar + `harness board` CLI + harness.board scripting + harnessBoard MCP, backed by shared HarnessCore BoardModel; PBI-BOARD-001..006. Docs only, no code changes. | ✅ Done |
| 58 | Fix ⌘\\ "Toggle Sidebar" first-press bug: toggleSidebar() previously coupled sidebar visibility with the file-editor split via a "focus mode" (isFocusModeActive/preFocusSidebarVisible/preFocusFileEditorVisible) — if a file editor split was open on a freshly-opened window, the first ⌘\\ press hid both sidebar and editor split instead of opening the sidebar. Decoupled: toggleSidebar() now purely flips settings.sidebarVisible; removed resetFocusMode() and the resetFocusMode: params on ContentAreaViewController.showFileEditorSplit/hideFileEditorSplit. Build + 67/67 HarnessAppTests + 1529/1529 full suite pass. | ✅ Done |
| 59 | P11 Scripting & Config API (PBI-SCRIPT-001/002/003): added JavaScriptCore-backed `ScriptRuntime`/`ScriptConfigLocator`/`ScriptHookCoordinator`/`ScriptFileWatcher`/`ScriptAPI`/`ScriptSnapshotModels` under Apps/Harness/Sources/HarnessApp/Scripting/. Config search order ($HARNESS_CONFIG_FILE → $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/harness/init.js → ~/.config/harness/init.js → ~/.harness.js), silent no-file startup, toast on reload/error with last-good-runtime retained, RL-011-style file watcher with debounce/re-arm, and read-only `harness.sessions.list()`/`harness.panes.list()`/`harness.commands.parse()` bridge. Fixed `ScriptRuntime` exceptionHandler to also set `context.exception` and `ScriptAPI.commands.parse` to use `String(describing:)` instead of `localizedDescription` so `CommandParseError` messages surface to JS. PBI-SCRIPT-004/005 not started (004 needs allowlisted config/keybinding writes; 005 gated behind P12 MCP pane-control per plan). Build + 74/74 HarnessAppTests pass. | ✅ Done |
| 60 | P4 Track 2/3: LSP CLI (`harness lsp start/status/hover/definition/diagnostics`) and `harness view` done; vi `:view/:edit/:split/:vsplit` done; fuzzy `:find`/partial path resolution partial (best-match, no picker); PBI-VI-001 partial (`gf` only, `gd`/`K`/diagnostic jumps not wired). Build + CLI/App/Completion tests pass. | ✅ Done |
| 61 | P4 Track 2 follow-up: completed PBI-VI-001 (`gd`, `K`, `]d`, `[d` wired through existing `LSPFileSession`/`SyntaxTextView` callbacks with graceful no-LSP/no-result status messages) and PBI-VI-003 ambiguous fuzzy handling (`:find`, `:edit <partial>`, `:view <partial>` list ranked ambiguous matches instead of opening first). Added App tests for fuzzy resolution and diagnostic navigation; `swift build`, HarnessAppTests, and HarnessCLITests pass. | ✅ Done |

### Removed / Reverted Features
- **Task Board sidebar** — was added in sprint #32 but has since been **removed**. Not present in current codebase.
- **Focus Mode (⌘P)** — status unclear; no TaskBoardView or FocusMode symbol found in source scan. Verify before documenting.
- **⌘1–9** — `selectSessionNumber` was renamed to `selectWorkspaceNumber` in v2.5.2. Confirmed CASE-028: it calls `selectSession(workspaceID:sessionID:)` over `workspace.sessions[index]` — switches the Session pill within the active workspace (matches the top bar 1:1), not workspaces/windows. See [[session-tab-hierarchy]].


### Recent_Lessons

- **RL-001:** ACP requires adapter binaries; can't ship reliably in .app bundle (PATH issues)
- **RL-002:** Shell tracker can't read env vars from /bin/zsh (macOS hardened runtime blocks KERN_PROCARGS2). CWD tracking relies on daemon-side proc_pidinfo polling only.
- **RL-003:** sortOrder must persist to UserDefaults on every drag, not just on quit
- **RL-004:** Never reparent Metal terminal surfaces for file preview split — causes 1-2s black screen (CASE-003). Use constraint-based sibling panel instead.
- **RL-005:** DispatchSource on .main queue directly (not .global with async hop) for Swift 6 MainActor isolation.
- **RL-006:** AppKit panels alongside Metal surfaces must apply opacity explicitly to their CALayer, but file editor/preview panels need a denser compensated alpha (`opacity + (1 - opacity) * 0.55`) rather than raw opacity. Metal handles terminal canvas alpha and terminal programs may paint opaque cell backgrounds, while preview text sits over mostly transparent AppKit canvas; raw parity can look too transparent. Hook into `applyChrome()` + panel-creation site. (CASE-011)
- **RL-007:** DispatchSource.makeFileSystemObjectSource on a directory is non-recursive — only detects root-level changes. Use FSEventStreamCreate with kFSEventStreamCreateFlagFileEvents for recursive watching. (CASE-016, CASE-021)
- **RL-008:** Swift actor + FSEvents C callback: use WatcherContext class (@unchecked Sendable) + Unmanaged.passRetained to pass onChange closure via FSEventStreamContext.info. Release in stopWatching via Unmanaged.fromOpaque().release(). (CASE-016)
- **RL-009:** SwiftUI @State in list rows resets on every view reconciliation. State that must survive tree refresh belongs in the @Observable model, not the View. (CASE-017)
- **RL-010:** NSView wrapping NSTextView must forward mouseDown/mouseDragged/mouseUp to the inner textView explicitly — super.mouseDown doesn't cascade to child views. (CASE-018)
- **RL-011:** For watching a single file (not a directory), plain `DispatchSource.makeFileSystemObjectSource(O_EVTONLY)` is sufficient — no need for FSEvents recursion (RL-007 only applies to directories). Re-arm by reopening the path on every reload to survive atomic-save-by-rename. For a reused `QLPreviewView`, call `refreshPreviewItem()` instead of re-setting an unchanged `previewItem` (QuickLook caches by URL). (CASE-022)
- **RL-012:** When a forced visual state on launch (e.g. collapse) diverges from the persisted toggle-state field, sync the persisted field too — otherwise the first user toggle computes against stale state and is a no-op. (CASE-024)
- **RL-013:** `TerminalModes.resetForShellPrompt()` (OSC 133;D) must only reset *input* modes (mouse tracking, bracketed paste, kitty keyboard, etc.), never `synchronizedOutput` — a sub-command's 133;D can fire mid-batch inside an outer TUI's `?2026h`/`?2026l` redraw, and clearing it there causes the renderer to present a half-applied frame (interleaved garbled rows). The 150ms sync-timeout in `HarnessTerminalSurfaceView` already handles a program that never sends `?2026l`. (CASE-023)
- **RL-014:** When extracting logic from large AppKit views: prefer standalone `enum` types with static methods for pure logic (geometry, validation, resolution). Keep the original method signature as a thin delegate — preserves the public API and test seams. Don't over-extract tightly-coupled state machines that would need large delegate protocols; those are better served by extension files.
- **RL-015:** Pure GUI-side states (like file editor tab lists and IDE mode visibility) should be persisted via `UserDefaults.standard` rather than modifying the shared daemon settings struct `HarnessSettings`, preventing binary compatibility issues.
- **RL-016:** On macOS/AppKit, to prevent click-gesture recognizers on parent stack views from intercepting clicks on child buttons, use `gestureRecognizer(_:shouldAttemptToRecognizeWith:)` of `NSGestureRecognizerDelegate` to selectively disable gesture recognition.
- **RL-017:** SwiftUI `List` in `NSHostingView` doesn't forward `keyDown` to the parent NSView. Add `acceptsFirstResponder = true` + `keyDown` override on the hosting NSView wrapper, then post notifications to SwiftUI rows via `NotificationCenter` for state changes (expand/collapse).
- **RL-018:** Modal vi engine inside `NSTextView`: set `isEditable = false` in normal mode and restore it only in insert mode. This prevents AppKit from consuming keystrokes meant for the vi engine. Use a `@MainActor final class` engine that holds `weak var textView: NSTextView?` and dispatches all mutations via `tv.isEditable = true; tv.replaceCharacters(...); tv.isEditable = false`.
- **RL-019:** `SyntaxLineNumberGutterView.draw()` receives a locally-unwrapped non-optional `textView` (from `guard let textView, ...`) — inside the draw closure `textView` is `NSTextView`, not `NSTextView?`. Conditional binding `if let tv2 = textView` inside that closure will fail to compile because it's already non-optional.
- **RL-020:** `window-size` vote aggregation: DaemonServer tracks per-client surface sizes; `applyEffectiveSize` picks the winning vote. Reading `registry.optionStore.get("window-size")` inside DaemonServer is correct since `optionStore` is `public let` on SurfaceRegistry.
- **RL-021:** "Pure transparent + always readable" is impossible without a tint layer. Apple proved this across iOS/macOS 26→27 (Liquid Glass): pure `.clear` window background fails when the content behind is bright. Fix: `window.backgroundColor = themeColor.withAlphaComponent(opacity)` instead of `.clear` — theme colour acts as tint at user-chosen strength, CGS blur still applies on top. iOS 27 added a user-facing transparency slider (ultra clear → fully tinted) as the definitive solution.
- **RL-022:** `selectSessionNumber` (⌘1–9) must call `selectSession(workspaceID:sessionID:)` not `selectWorkspace(byIndex:)`. The latter is a no-op when only one workspace exists (index 0 already active), and out-of-bounds for index ≥ 1. Always navigate workspace → sessions array → select by ID.
- **RL-023:** The async `syncFromDaemon` variant must mirror every side-effect of the sync variant — including `terminalHosts.prune(keeping:)` on structure changes. Missing it causes dead TerminalHostViews (and their Metal surfaces) to accumulate for the app lifetime because the `scheduleSnapshotRefresh()` path always uses the async variant.
- **RL-024:** `unichar` (UInt16) can hold surrogate code units (0xD800–0xDFFF). `UnicodeScalar(unichar)` returns nil for those — force-unwrapping it crashes on malformed clipboard content. Always `guard let scalar = UnicodeScalar(c) else { return <safe_default> }` when converting unichar → Character.
- **RL-025:** Any per-cell state tied to terminal content (selection, marks, cursors held across frames) must be stored in **virtual-line space** (`historyCount - scrollOffset + viewportRow`, 0 = oldest retained line), not viewport-relative `(row, column)`. Viewport-relative coordinates silently go stale the moment `scrollOffset` changes. Copy mode (`CopyModePosition`/`CopyModeGridSource`) already used this convention; mouse selection didn't, causing scroll to clear/misplace selections (CASE-029). `TerminalEmulator.line(_:)`/`bufferLine(_:)` are virtual-line indexed and return blank rows out-of-range — safe to read without clamping for display/copy purposes.
- **RL-026:** `SurfaceRegistry.sessions` (the PTY-session dict consulted by `send`/`capturePane`/`capturePaneRange`/etc.) is keyed by the layout `PaneLeaf.activeSurfaceID` (or `.surfaceID`) `.uuidString` — the same `SurfaceID` UUID used in `PaneNode`/`Tab`. `PaneSurface.daemonSurfaceID` is a separate optional field that is *not* populated in current snapshots; don't use it as the IPC surface key (CASE: P12 PBI-ORCH-001, `harnessList`'s `surfaceId`).

### Decisions_In_Force

- **ACP shelved** — re-enable when adapters ship with agent CLIs natively
- **Agent tab hidden** — 4th sidebar segment commented out, code preserved
- **CWD tracking** — daemon polls proc_pidinfo every 500ms (lightweight); no shell integration needed
- **File preview** — constraint-based sibling panel (never reparent terminal views)
- **vi mode** — `ViNormalMode.swift` is a self-contained engine (`@MainActor final class ViEngine`); `SyntaxTextView` owns the instance and wires callbacks. Notifications used for cross-layer actions (:q → `viQuitCommand`, :e → `viOpenFileCommand`, :bn/:bp → `viNextBufferCommand`).
- **⌘1–9** — switches Session pills (top bar) within the active workspace via `selectSession`; **⌘[ / ⌘]** — Previous/Next Session via `selectAdjacentSession` (CASE-028). "Tab within Session" has no visible UI and its menu shortcuts/dead code were removed — see [[session-tab-hierarchy]].
- **Keyboard file tree** — `FileTreeKeyboardNav.swift` holds `FileTreeKeyboardState` (@Observable); AppKit (`WorkspaceFileTreeView.keyDown`) writes, SwiftUI (`NodeRow`) reads for highlight; `updateVisiblePaths()` keeps flat ordered list in sync

## Known Issues
- **Split right 4+ panes slightly uneven** — NSSplitView default resize compresses middle panes. Tolerable.
- **CWD detection latency** — up to 500ms after `cd` for sidebar to update (daemon poll interval). Acceptable.

## Strategic Backlog (Competitive Gap Analysis, 2026-06-13)
WezTerm/tmux/cmux comparison surfaced 3 capability gaps. Image protocols (Kitty/iTerm2/Sixel)
checked and confirmed already at parity with WezTerm — no plan needed there.

- `plans/p11-scripting-config-api.md` — P3, scriptable config/event-hooks (WezTerm Lua parity), JavaScriptCore-based
- `plans/p12-agent-orchestration-mcp.md` — P2, extend `harness-mcp` with pane control tools (cmux socket-API parity); also addresses ACP's "no tool control" blocker via PBI-ORCH-004. **PBI-ORCH-001 done** (harnessList/readPaneOutput read-only tools)
- `plans/p13-embedded-browser.md` — P3, WKWebView pane as new `PaneNode` leaf (cmux embedded browser parity); depends on P12 for scripting

P12 started (PBI-ORCH-001 done); P11, P13, P14 not started — idea-stage only.

## Completed Sprints
- **v1.3.0** — IDE-like Sidebar (PBI-001): Files tab, Git tab, session tabs, recent projects
- **v1.4.0** — Git panel: Commit ▼ menu, Sync button with per-remote options
- **v1.5.0** — CMUX split panes, N-ary flatten, host reuse, split down removed
- **v2.0.0** — File preview, sidebar polish, agent icon art
- **v2.1.0** — ACP Client, real-time Git, history→file editor

## Architecture Notes
- Sidebar: `HarnessSidebarPanelViewController` — tabs (Sessions/Files/Git) via NSSegmentedControl (Agent tab hidden)
- Sidebar position: `MainSplitViewController.updateSidebarPlacement()` — reorders NSSplitView subviews
- File tree: `WorkspaceFileTreeView` → `FileTreeSwiftUIView` (SwiftUI) with `FileTreeWatcher` (FSEvents); keyboard nav via `FileTreeKeyboardNavigator` + `FileTreeKeyboardState` (@Observable)
- Git panel: `GitPanelView` — changes/history/worktrees; FSEvents recursive watcher on rootPath (utility queue, 500ms debounce)
- Split panes: `PaneContainerView` builds from `PaneNode` binary tree; `HarnessSplitView` per branch node
- Sessions: `SessionCoordinator.shared` — async IPC, snapshot notifications via `NotificationBus.shared.snapshotChanged`
- File preview: `ContentAreaViewController.showFileEditorSplit()` — constraint-based sibling panel (40% editor / 60% terminal), never reparents terminal views; `refreshEditorPanelFill()` uses compensated opacity so editor preview visually matches terminal density
- File preview live reload: `FileChangeWatcher` (Services/FileExplorer) — single-file DispatchSource, 0.3s debounce, used by `FileEditorView` and `FileViewerViewController` to reload on external edits
- File editor vi mode: `ViEngine` in `ViNormalMode.swift` — `@MainActor final class`, wired via `SyntaxTextView.vi`; callbacks: `onSave`, `onQuit`, `onOpenFile`, `onSetOption`, `onNextBuffer`, `onSearchHighlight`; ex commands post notifications (`viQuitCommand`, `viOpenFileCommand`, `viNextBufferCommand`)
- LSP: `LSPFileSession` in `HarnessApp/UI/` wraps `HarnessLSP.LSPClient`; auto-detects Swift/TS/Python/Rust/Go by project markers; hover + go-to-def + diagnostics wired in `FileEditorView`
- CWD tracking: `AgentScanner.cwdTimer` (500ms) → `SurfaceRegistry.refreshCwdOnly()` (proc_pidinfo) → `snapshotChanged` → sidebar reload
- ACP Client: SHELVED — code intact (`ACPClient`, `ACPSession`, `AgentChatPanelView`, `AgentConfig`)
- Preview uses `.harness-preview/` — socket path max 103 bytes (use `/tmp/hp` symlink for worktree)
- SoftIconButton: supports `rightMouseDown` → pops up assigned `.menu`
- ⌘1–9: `MenuTarget.selectWorkspaceNumber` → `SessionCoordinator.selectSession(workspaceID:sessionID:)` over `workspace.sessions[index]` (renamed from selectSessionNumber in v2.5.1; confirmed CASE-028 — not `selectWorkspace(byIndex:)`)
- fzf: installed at `/opt/homebrew/bin/fzf` (v0.73.1); shell integration sourced via `source <(fzf --zsh)` in ~/.zshrc — Ctrl+R history, Ctrl+T files, Option+C cd. Terminal input pipeline sends ESC-prefix for Option keys natively.
- tmux: `window-size` option read in `DaemonServer.applyEffectiveSize`; `list-*` commands in `MainExecutor` render `-F` format strings and `--json` arrays
