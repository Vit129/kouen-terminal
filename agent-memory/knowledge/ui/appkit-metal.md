# AppKit + Metal Patterns

## CADisplayLink Lifetime on macOS (CASE-031)

**Critical difference from iOS:** On macOS, `NSView.displayLink(target:selector:)` does NOT
strongly retain the target view. If the view is deallocated while the display link is still
scheduled in the run loop, the link fires on a dangling pointer → EXC_BAD_ACCESS.

On iOS, `CADisplayLink(target:selector:)` strongly retains its target, so deinit never runs
while the link is active. The macOS factory (added in macOS 14) behaves differently — it uses
an unsafe/weak reference internally.

**Pattern:** Always add a `deinit` that invalidates the display link and any scheduled timers:
```swift
nonisolated(unsafe) var blinkTimer: Timer?
private nonisolated(unsafe) var renderLink: CADisplayLink?

deinit {
    renderLink?.invalidate()
    blinkTimer?.invalidate()
}
```

**Why `nonisolated(unsafe)`:** Swift 6 strict concurrency forbids accessing `@MainActor`-isolated
stored properties from a nonisolated `deinit`. Marking them `nonisolated(unsafe)` opts out of
the isolation check. This is safe because deinit runs after all references are gone — no
concurrent access is possible.

**When this crashes:** Rapid session create/close cycles (especially with welcome banner
injection on every new surface) increase the chance that `viewDidMoveToWindow(nil)` is skipped
or races with deallocation. The deinit is the last-resort safety net.

## Metal Surface Lifecycle (CASE-003)

Terminal uses Metal/CADisplayLink for rendering. When a pane tree is rebuilt (removeFromSuperview + re-add in same window), the Metal surface goes black.

**Fix:** Override `viewDidMoveToSuperview()` in `HarnessTerminalSurfaceView`: if `window != nil`, stop+start display link + scheduleRender.

**Why:** Metal's CADisplayLink doesn't survive a superview detach/reattach cycle. The display link loses its target and stops firing. Explicitly restarting it on reattach restores rendering.

## Overlay Above Metal (CASE-004)

Metal CALayer composites above all sibling layers regardless of `zPosition`. Standard `addSubview(positioned:above:)` doesn't work.

**Workaround:** Use `HitTestPassthroughView` with `layer?.zPosition = 1000`. Works for small overlays (split buttons, pills) but a full-frame overlay blocks Metal render.

**Pattern:** Keep overlays as small hit-test-passthrough views with high zPosition. Never cover the full Metal surface.

## NSView Layer Opacity — Preview Parity Pattern (CASE-011)

AppKit NSViews that sit alongside Metal surfaces (file editor, sidebar chrome) must
explicitly apply opacity to their CALayer background to match the terminal's translucency.
Simply leaving `backgroundColor = .clear` makes them rely on raw window vibrancy, which
ignores the user's opacity slider.

File editor/preview panels are a special case: raw opacity parity can still look too
transparent beside terminal content. The terminal renderer applies opacity to the default
canvas, but terminal programs may paint opaque cell backgrounds. Preview text usually sits
over a transparent AppKit canvas, so the panel needs a denser compensated alpha.

**Pattern:**
```swift
let opacity = CGFloat(HarnessSettings.clampedOpacity(settings.backgroundOpacity))
let editorOpacity = min(1, opacity + (1 - opacity) * 0.55)
panel.layer?.backgroundColor = HarnessChrome.current.terminalBackground
    .withAlphaComponent(editorOpacity).cgColor
```

**Key points:**
- Call this in `applyChrome()` (responds to theme/opacity changes) AND at panel-creation time.
- `HarnessSettings.clampedOpacity` returns `Float` — cast to `CGFloat` for `withAlphaComponent`.
- Use compensated alpha for the editor/preview panel; use raw opacity only for chrome surfaces
  that do not need to visually match terminal-rendered content.
- Subviews (`scrollView`, `textView`, gutter) that already draw transparent don't need changes;
  the panel layer background shows through them automatically.
- The terminal host uses a different approach (clear when translucent, solid when opaque)
  because the Metal renderer handles its own alpha; AppKit-only panels must do it themselves.
- `PaneContainerView.refreshChrome(snapshot:)` should call `applyChrome()` directly; an empty
  host lookup loop creates warning noise and does not refresh panel colors.

**Files:** `ContentAreaViewController.swift` → `refreshEditorPanelFill()` / `applyChrome()`

## Window Background Tint for Legibility (CASE-027)

**Problem:** When `backgroundOpacity < 1`, `window.backgroundColor = .clear` + CGS blur gives
a fully transparent backdrop. If the content behind the window is bright (Finder, browser,
document), terminal text becomes unreadable — pure transparency has no tint to provide
contrast.

**Apple's approach (iOS/macOS 26–27):** The "Liquid Glass" material uses a semi-opaque tinted
backing (`UIVisualEffectView.backgroundColor = theme_color.withAlpha(...)`) instead of pure
clear. iOS 27 added a user-facing transparency slider (ultra clear → fully tinted) after
community feedback that pure transparency hurt legibility. The lesson: "pure transparent +
always readable" is impossible without a tint layer.

**Fix applied:** In `MainWindowController.applyChrome()`, instead of `.clear`, set:
```swift
window.backgroundColor = HarnessChrome.current.terminalBackground
    .withAlphaComponent(CGFloat(opacity))
```
The theme colour acts as a tint at whatever strength the opacity slider is set. At 100 % it
is fully opaque (unchanged); at lower values the blur shows through but the tint ensures
contrast. CGS blur still applies on top.

**Files:** `MainWindowController.swift` → `applyChrome()`

## NSFont Italic (CASE-010)

NSFont has no `.italicSystemFont` (unlike UIFont).

**Fix:** `NSFontManager.shared.convert(.systemFont(ofSize:), toHaveTrait: .italicFontMask)`

## Mouse Selection Must Use Virtual-Line Coordinates (CASE-029)

**Problem:** `HarnessTerminalSurfaceView.selectionAnchor`/`selectionHead` were stored as
viewport-relative `(row, column)`. Scrolling reinterpreted the same row numbers against new
content, and `scrollByContinuous`/`scrollToBufferLine` unconditionally called
`clearSelection()` — so any scroll while a selection was held wiped or misplaced it, and
`selectionTextIfAny()` read from a `readGrid(scrollbackOffset:)` snapshot at the *current*
scroll position, which no longer matched the selection's rows.

**Fix:** Store selection endpoints as **virtual-line** positions
(`historyCount - scrollOffset + viewportRow`, 0 = oldest retained line) — the exact
coordinate space `CopyModeGridSource`/`CopyModePosition` already use for copy mode ("Vi"), so
it's scroll-stable by construction. `selectionTopLine` (= `historyCount - scrollOffset`)
converts between the two spaces: `mouseDown`/`mouseDragged`/`selectAll` add it to a viewport
row to get a virtual line; `currentSelectionRegion`/`SelectionResolver.resolve` subtract it
from a virtual line to get the *current* viewport row for rendering. Removed the
`clearSelection()` calls from both scroll paths — a selection now survives scrolling.
`selectionTextIfAny()` now reads each selected line via `TerminalEmulator.line(_:)`
(`CopyModeGridSource` conformance, also virtual-line indexed) instead of a viewport snapshot,
so copy is correct regardless of scroll position.

**Files:** `HarnessTerminalSurfaceView.swift` (`selectionAnchor`/`selectionHead`,
`testingSetSelection`), `HarnessTerminalSurfaceView+SelectionAndLinks.swift`
(`selectionTopLine`, `currentSelectionRegion`, `mouseDown`/`mouseDragged`), `SelectionResolver.swift`,
`HarnessTerminalSurfaceView+Find.swift` (`selectAll`, `selectionTextIfAny`),
`HarnessTerminalSurfaceView+Scrollback.swift` (removed `clearSelection()` calls).
